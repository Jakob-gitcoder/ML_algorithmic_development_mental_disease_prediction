## How to run this project / Requirements
### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine:
    
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): Create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.
    
    ```
    python -m venv env
    env\Scripts\activate
    ```
    
3. **Install Dependencies**: Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all the required libraries.
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4. **Jupyter Notebook Installation**: Since the project is developed in Jupyter notebooks, ensure that Jupyter is installed. You can install it with:
    
    ```
    pip install jupyter
    ```
    

### Running the Project

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: To run the project, start Jupyter Notebook from the command line:
    
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    
    This command will open Jupyter in your default web browser. From there, navigate to the notebook files of the project.
    
2. **Select the Notebook**: Open the specific notebook(s) you want to explore. Each notebook will contain data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
3. **Run Cells**: Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis. Ensure that the data files are in the appropriate locations as mentioned in the notebook. If there are specific configurations, they will be mentioned in the comments within the notebook.
